# Toon Generative Adversarial Network(GAN)
The aim of this project is to utalize a pytorch based Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) to develop a neural network capable of generating cartoon faces. The developed model takes random noise and generates 128X128 pixeled images. The model was trained on gpus offered by google on the googlecolab environment and I would recommend that the files be run there for consistent results.
